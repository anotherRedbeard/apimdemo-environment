However, clients can also configure truncation to retain messages up to a fraction of the maximum context size, which will reduce the need for future truncations and thus improve the cache rate.\n\nTruncation can be disabled entirely, which means the server will never truncate but would instead return an error if the conversation exceeds the model's input token limit."
